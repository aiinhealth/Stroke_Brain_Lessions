"An Artificial Intelligence approach for segmenting and classifying
brain lesions caused by stroke"

Abstract: "Brain injuries caused by strokes are one of the leading causes of disability worldwide.
Current procedures require a specialized physician to analyze MRI images before
diagnosing and deciding on the specific treatment. However, the procedure can be
costly and time-consuming. Artificial intelligence techniques are becoming a game-
changer for analyzing MRI images. This work proposes an end-to-end approach in
three stages: Pre-processing techniques for normalizing the images to the standard
MNI space, as well as inhomogeneities and bias corrections; lesion segmentation
using a CNN network, trained for cerebrovascular accidents and feature extraction;
and, classification for determining the vascular territory within which the lesion
occurred. A CLCI-Net was used for stroke segmentation. Four Deep Learning (DL)
and four Shallow Machine Learning (ML) network architectures were evaluated to
assess the strokes’ territory localization. All models’ architectures were designed,
analyzed, and compared based on their performance scores, reaching an accuracy
of 84% with the DL models and 95% with the Shallow ML models. The proposed
methodology may be helpful for rapid and accurate stroke assessment for an acute
treatment to minimize patient complications."
